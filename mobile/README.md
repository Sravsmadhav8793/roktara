# Roktara Android release

The Android package is a Trusted Web Activity for the HTTPS service. It uses the same browser session, Google sign-in, and device passkeys as the web app.

- Package: `com.sravantix.roktara`
- Target API: 36
- Version: 1.0.0 (code 1)
- Signed bundle: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/signed-release.aab`
- Store files: `store/`
- Privacy and deletion pages: `../public/privacy.html`, `../public/delete-account.html`

## Rebuild

Run `npm ci` and `npm run generate` in this directory. With JDK 17 and Android SDK 36 installed, run `android/gradlew.bat bundleRelease` on Windows. Run `node sign-release.mjs` to sign with the existing upload key and verify the result. The upload key and DPAPI-encrypted password are under ignored `../release-secrets/`; make an independent secure backup. Never regenerate the key for an existing Play app. Increase `appVersionCode` in `twa-manifest.json` before the next upload.

The public `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` currently contains the upload certificate fingerprint for local testing. After Play App Signing is activated, add the **Play app-signing** SHA-256 fingerprint and redeploy the site. The Play certificate differs from the upload certificate.

Before submission, verify installation and login on a physical Android device, complete Play Console app-content and Data safety declarations, and provide reviewer access that does not expose the owner's private records. If these apps are submitted through the existing personal developer account, each app needs at least 12 opted-in closed testers for 14 continuous days before applying for production access. Google recommends an organization developer account for financial services, which applies to the accounting and investment apps.
